	                   	<p>Our survey was filled out by 160 individuals within the age range of 18-40 to understand their media consumption habits. Most respondents were in their early 20s and received some level of college education. </p>
	                   	<p>We found that social media was the most popular form of news consumption within this demographic. 90.6 percent of our respondents indicated that they used social media for news. </p>
	                   	<p>Only 33.8 percent of the respondents used a news app, and 44 percent said that they were "Somewhat likely" to download an app.</p>
	                   	<p>Surprisingly, only 1.9 percent of the respondents said that they preferred to consume news by watching TV. The two most popular forms of news consumption were articles and online videos, favored by 69.2 and 60.4 percent of respondents respectively.</p>

            	<p class="text-muted section-subheading"><em>"Local news is the backbone of American media. Millions rely on it for investigative journalism and relatable personal interest stories. Those folks work hard to keep their communities up to date and they have my utmost respect."</em> </p>
            	<p class="text-muted section-subheading"><em>"I'm a writer myself; I know not everything goes into a story. For the most part I trust my news sources only to omit parts that are very inconsequential to the presented information and details, but because I am always aware that there are tidbits floating in the ether, I will always be somewhat suspicious, cautious, and questioning of the information being given to me. Looking for that 'angle' in which the story is told-- and what is subsequently included and excluded in the final product."</em></p>
            	<p class="text-muted section-subheading"><em>"When it comes to Chicagoland news, I believe the platforms I follow are pretty accurate. They bring a topic up, explain it, and leave their opinions to themselves.unless it's weather, they help with suggestions on what not or what to bring on your daily commute. They express what they care about by adding their own segments, for example, community events in the areas and keep Chicagoans informed of any severe weather that might put us at harms risk. The anchors I follow might address their opinions on some Chicagoland topics, like sports, but they do not create false allegations."</em></p>

                                		<p>NBC 5 does an excellent job of covering news within the Chicago area, and it even provides an option to watch live TV that is easy to find. Both the site and app provide thorough articles, accompanied with photos and videos when applicable. Although a photo is not shown for every headline on the site, tags are placed to clearly indicate that an article contains video content. This order makes it easy to read several headlines in rapid succession.  </p>
                                		<p>The site also advertises weather, the station’s charitable events, and special features like NBC 5 Responds and Investigates. Additionally, the sports section is very easy to find on the home page.</p>
                                		<p class="this-item item-intro text-muted" id="consnbc5">Cons</p>
                                		<p>Although there are a few tweets in the lower half of the page, the homepage does a poor job of connecting the site to the station’s social media platforms.</p>
                                	</div>
                                	<div class="tab-pane" id="nbc5webdesign">
                                		<h3>Website Design</h3>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted" id="nbc5desktop">Desktop</p>
                                		<p><b>Organization</b>: The top menu of the website is neatly organized and easy to navigate. However, the bottom menu has several options that could confuse the user, and the font is a bit small.
                                		Additionally, the home page is a bit confusing because the font size of each category is small and easy to overlook.</p>
                                		<p><b>Photos</b>: The photos on the homepage could be larger to catch the viewer’s eye.</p>
                                		<p><b>Feature Size</b>: Many of the buttons on the site, especially those connecting to social media, are small and easy to miss. However, the slideshows and categories have a lightweight and aesthetically pleasing design.</p>
                                		<p><b>Ad Size &amp; Placement</b>: Although the ads on the homepage are effective, they are large and distracting in other categories of the site. On some pages, the ads take up more space than the actual content. Occasionally, the site opens up ads in another tab, creating an inconvenient experience for the user.</p>
                                		<p><b>White Space</b>: Placing white space on the sides of a page’s layout is an effective way of concentrating content in one area to focus the user’s eye on what is important. However, NBC 5’s homepage has a little too much white space. The extra space could be used to make photos and videos larger and more eye-catching. </p>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted" id="nbc5mobile">Mobile</p>
                                		<p><b>Overview</b>: The mobile site stacks headlines, videos, and photos on top of each other to make it easier to scroll through. This simplistic design makes it easy for users to find featured stories on the homepage.</p>
                                		<p><b>Organization</b>: The menu of the mobile site is not as organized as the desktop version. The side menu reveals several options that the user has to scroll through, which may create a confusing experience. There is also a menu towards the top that the user can slide through, but its functionality is not clear at first. This top menu is also tiny and easy to overlook.</p>
                                		<p><b>Feature Size</b>: Like the desktop version, the buttons of the mobile site are small and easy to overlook. There are also very few icons that connect to the station’s social media platforms.</p>
                                		<p><b>Ad Size &amp; Placement</b>: Unlike the desktop version of the site, the ads are placed in a way that they are not overwhelming.</p>

                                		<p><b>Feature Size</b>: The social media icons are even smaller on the app than they are on the mobile site, making them hard to find.</p>
                                		<p><b>Push Notifications</b>: The app sends regular and frequent notifications about various topics. Some of the more common topics are about weather, traffic, sports, and breaking news.</p>

                                		<p>The NBC 5 Facebook page mostly features article links to the station’s website. There appears to be minimal videos and little to no interaction with viewers. These posts do not appear to be very popular, and usually stay within the range of 20-300 likes. When compared to the number of followers on NBC 5’s Facebook page, this ratio is very low.</p>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted"><b>Twitter</b>: 382 thousand followers</p>
                                		<p>NBC 5’s Twitter page consists of article links and retweets from reporters. The page rarely uses hashtags and does not seem to interact with viewers often. Most Tweets receive very few likes and retweets, only occasionally exceeding 10 likes.</p>
                                		<p>In terms of content, NBC 5’s Twitter page is relatively diverse, focusing on weather, traffic, crime, recalls, and sports.</p>

                                		<p>NBC 5’s Instagram features images of talent and beautiful shots of Chicago. Many of the photos are re-posts from viewers or reporters, who are encouraged to tag #nbcchicago for a chance to be featured.</p>
                                		<p>The station’s Instagram seems to be more successful than its other social media platforms. Most Instagram posts receive 100-500 likes.</p>

		                                <p class="item-intro text-muted tab-intro" id="abc7pros">Pros</p>
		                                <p>The content of ABC 7's website correlates well with what is posted on the app. On both the site and the app, ABC 7 delivers thorough news about the Chicago area, along with multimedia content to accompany each story. The multimedia content, which includes videos, photos, and interactive photo slideshows, provides a more engaging experience for the viewer. </p>
		                                <p>ABC 7 localizes its areas of coverage through these platforms, making it easier for viewers to find information that directly applies to them. Its menu is broken down into the following neighborhoods: Chicago &amp; Suburban Cook Co., Northern Suburbs, Western Suburbs, Southern Suburbs, and NW Indiana.</p>
		                                <p>The site and app also have helpful updates about weather on traffic. ABC 7 provides an hourly and weekly weather forecast on both platforms, along with weather maps for various Illinois counties. Additionally, the interactive traffic map creates a more engaging experience for users.  </p>
		                                <p class="item-intro text-muted tab-intro" id="abc7cons">Cons</p>
		                                <p>Although ABC 7 provides extensive coverage, the tone of many of the station's headlines are negative, especially when presenting violent news. For example, on July 20, 2017, the most popular stories were:</p>
		                                <div id="headlines" class="text-center">
		                                <b>Teen fatally shot in Hammond while answering door</b>
		                                <br><b>3 injured in Edens wreck; more rain falls on flooded communities</b>
		                                <br><b>2 women arrested after baby falls out of restaurant trash</b>
		                                <br><br>
		                                </div>
		                                <p>Although these stories present negative news, these topics can be delivered in a more sensitive manner to account for the communities that are affected by these stories.</p>
		                                <p>Additionally, the menu of both the site and app is too cluttered, overwhelming users with more options than they want. Although the menu of the app is more concise, the website has over 30 options in its dropdown menu alone, making it hard for users to find what they are looking for.
		                                </p>

		                                <p class="item-intro text-muted" id="abc7desktop">Desktop</p>
		                                <p><b>Organization</b>: The desktop version of the website is cluttered and overwhelming. Although there are several menu sections, it is hard to tell how the stories featured in the homepage relate to these sections.</p>
		                                <p><b>Photos</b>: The site's design emphasizes that each story has some form of multimedia content to attract the viewer. However, the thumbnails are large and poorly organized in the lower half of the homepage, and they even overshadow the headlines below them. The thumbnails on the sidebar are not even in-line with the other sections of this part of the homepage.</p>
		                                <p><b>Feature Size</b>: The button size of ABC 7's website are too small, making it easy to miss them. It can be hard to find social media features or identify that something is a slideshow.</p>
		                                <p><b>Ad Size &amp; Placement</b>: Most of the ads on the site are large and inconvenienty placed. Upon opening the homepage, an ad in the footer appears, which distracts the user from the important content on the site. Although the ads take up a substantial amount of space on the page, the font on some of ABC 7's own ads is too small to read unless the user zooms in. </p>
		                                <p><b>White Space</b>: ABC 7's site feels cluttered and disorganized because little room is left for white space. Proper spacing not only makes web design more aesthetically pleasing, but also easier for the user to understand the organizational layout.</p>
		                                <p class="item-intro text-muted" id="abc7mobile">Mobile</p>
		                                <p>The mobile version of the website is very similar to the desktop version and has much of the same design issues. However, in order to adapt to the smaller mobile frame, the mobile site design is a bit simpler.</p>

		                                <p><b>Organization</b>: ABC 7's app is organized more effectively than its website. The stories are easy to find as the user scrolls down the opening page. However, like the website, the app faces the same problem of having too many categories in the main menu.</p>
		                                <p><b>Feature Size</b>: Like the website, the app's buttons are small and look stylistically outdated.</p>
		                                <p><b>Push Notifications</b>: The app sends regular and helpful notifications that are mostly about weather. However, this feature requires the user's permission to be enabled.</p>

		                                <p>ABC 7 features short previews of its newscasts on its Facebook page, along with beautiful photos of Chicago. Some of the most popular posts are Facebook Live videos, Captured on Camera phone videos from viewers, and questions that ask for a response from followers. These posts receive over 1 thousand likes. Each post also has a caption that starts with an eye-catching introduction in caps.  </p>
		                                <p>The ratio of ABC 7's followers to the number of likes on its posts appears to be low. Although ABC 7's Facebook page has close to 2 million followers, the station's posts rarely rarely receive over 1 thousand likes. It is even common for a post to receive as little as 50 likes. </p>
		                                <p class="item-intro text-muted"><b>Twitter</b>: 658 thousand followers</p>
		                                <p>The Twitter page mostly features still images from newscasts, with little video content. ABC 7 rarely receives retrweets and likes on its Tweets. Most posts rarely exceed 100 likes and retweets, and many receive as little as 10 likes and retweets.</p>

                                		<p id="nbcadvantage">NBC 5 does a better job of organizing its website and app. The layout of these products is significantly cleaner than ABC 7’s products. Overall, the site looks more modern and lightweight, following recent web design trends. In addition, it publishes more varied content and posts less negative headlines than its competitor. The ads on NBC 5’s page also do not hinder the user’s experience the way ABC 7’s do. However, there is still room for improvement, and many of the features on the website can be made larger to catch the viewer’s eye. In addition, although there are several advertisements for community events throughout the site, it may be helpful to have a single page or calendar to easily find these events in one place.  </p>

                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted">Social Media</p>
                                		<p id="abcadvantage">ABC 7 appears to have the upperhand when it comes to social media. The station’s engagement with its viewers is substantially better, and it is clear that they interact with them regularly. As a result, the station’s posts generally receive more likes than NBC 5’s does. This higher social media engagement may contribute to ABC 7’s higher ranking than NBC 5 when Googling “Chicago local news.” NBC 5 can increase its social media engagement by interacting with its viewers as much as ABC 7 does. The station can reply to comments from followers and post questions and trivia that influence the user to respond. In addition, NBC 5 can include larger buttons on its website to share articles via Facebook and Twitter.</p>

                                		<h3>Content</h3>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted" id="telemundopros">Pros</p>
                                		<p>Telemundo Chicago focuses on delivering news to the Latino community in the Chicago area. The content directly applies to this demographic, featuring specific content like telenovelas (Spanish soap operas) and health within Latin American countries (listed under Salud) on the homepage. Since the majority of Chicago’s Latino population identifies as Mexican, the site also has a separate section dedicated to news from Mexico.</p>
                                		<p>The Spanish TV station provides extensive coverage about entertainment, weather, and crime. Weather, especially, is promoted well on the site and is one of the homepage’s more prominent features.</p>
                                		<p>In addition, the website effectively advertises NBC Universal’s special charity programs, like Apoyando A Nuestras Escuelas (Supporting Our Schools). </p>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted" id="telemundopros">Cons</p>
                                		<p>Looking at the homepage, local news does not seem to be the site’s main focus. There is a small section underneath the slider for featured photos and videos dedicated to local news (Noticiero Telemundo Chicago). </p>
                                		<p>Although immigration is a popular topic within the Latino American community, it does not have its own section featured on the site’s homepage. There is, however, a tab labelled inmigración (immigration), in the top menu bar that scrolls down.</p>
                                		<p>In addition, Telemundo’s site has a separate section for crime (Crimen y Criminales) that is usually not seen on American news sites. This section specifically features negative content that may be a turnoff for some viewers. However, since this section is small and balanced out by the more lighthearted entertainment headlines, it might escape the viewer’s eye. </p>
                                	</div>
                                	<div class="tab-pane" id="telemundowebdesign">
                                		<h3>Website Design</h3>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted" id="telemundodesktop">Desktop</p>
                                		<p><b>Organization</b>: Overall, the site is well organized and easy to navigate. The top menu is divided into intuitive sections that are broken down into comprehensive drop down menus. The design of these menus is especially appealing because of the eye-catching images that accompany the featured articles. However, the large menu at the footer is harder to navigate since several categories are listed and the font is rather small. </p>
                                		<p><b>Photos</b>: Telemundo Chicago’s website makes good use of photos through interactive sliders and appealing thumbnails that accompany the top articles for each section.</p>
                                		<p><b>Feature Size</b>: Although the button designs on Telemundo Chicago’s website are aesthetically appealing, they are rather small and can easily escape the viewer’s eye. For example, there are very few icons that link the site to social media. The icons on the homepage are in the bottom footer and are tiny. </p>
                                		<p><b>Ad Size &amp; Placement</b>: The ads effectively advertise Telemundo’s mobile app and special TV shows. Overall, there is a decent number of ads, and they do not overwhelm the rest of the content on the website. </p>
                                		<p><b>White Space</b>: Telemundo Chicago’s website effectively uses white space on the sides of each page to make the main content more compact and visibly appealing. However, there could be less white space on the sides to make the site’s main content slightly larger and more eye-catching.</p>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted" id="telemundomobile">Mobile</p>
                                		<p><b>Organization</b>: The mobile site matches the desktop version well and effectively encourages the user to download the mobile app.</p>
                                		<p><b>Organization</b>: The organization of the mobile site is less intuitive than the desktop version. The pop-up side menu is broken up into confusing categories. For example, after clicking on Noticiero Telemundo Chicago, a drop-down menu appears that also features Noticiero Telemundo Chicago as a subcategory. In addition, some of the menu sections are redundant, such as the Noticias En Fotos (News in Photos), Fotos Y Videos (Photos and Videos), and Envía Fotos Y Videos (Send Photos and Videos) sections, which can be grouped together. Aside from this menu, it is not intuitive that the banner in the header labelled Inicio, Noticias, etc. can be scrolled through horizontally. This interactive feature may not even be necessary since only one section is hidden. </p>
                                		<p><b>Feature Size &amp; Functionality</b>: The only obvious links to social media on the website are located at the bottom of the pop-up sidebar, and their icons are small and easy to overlook. In addition, links like Visita nuestra página hermana NBC Chicago do not work. Upon clicking, on the NBC Chicago logo, the site opens a new tab to telemundochicago.com. This feature linking Telemundo Chicago’s mobile site to NBC Chicago also is not visible on the desktop version of the site. </p>

                                		<h3>App Design</h3>
                                		<p><b>Overview</b>: The mobile app looks very similar to the mobile website, aside from the from the menu features. The menu of the mobile app is better organized, and there is an interactive weather radar that is easy to access. The app overall has a lightweight design that his easy to navigate. </p>
                                		<p><b>Feature Size</b>: Like the mobile website, the social media icons are tiny and are only visible at the bottom of the side menu. </p>
                                		<p><b>Push Notifications</b>: The app sends helpful and frequent push notifications about a wide variety of topics. Some of the most frequent notifications are about weather. Although the notifications are sent regularly, the frequency is not enough to annoy the user. </p>
                                		<p><b>Ad Size &amp; Placement</b>: Sometimes when opening the app, full screen ads appear that can potentially annoy the user. Otherwise, the smaller banners and images embedded throughout the site serve as effective advertisements.</p>
                                	</div>

                                		<h3>Instagram</h3>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted">Facebook: Over 500 thousand likes and followers</p>
                                		<p>Telemundo Chicago does a good job of posting consistently and relevantly. However, the page lacks an events tab that can help advertise community events that Telemundo sponsors. In addition, Telemundo Chicago does not interact much with its followers, rarely commenting back. </p>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted">Twitter: 15.7 thousand followers</p>
                                		<p>Although Telemundo Chicago updates its page frequently, its posts do not seem to have many likes, retweets, or comments. In addition, the Twitter page has a good combination of posts about local news, national news, and entertainment. However, there seems to be little variety in the type of media that Telemundo Chicago posts on its Twitter page. Almost all of the posts seem to be article links, and the page could benefit from video posts or questions that would engage followers.</p>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted">Social Media: 1.2 thousand followers</p>
                                		<p>Telemundo Chicago consistently posts good quality pictures on Instagram, but these posts do not seem to yield many likes. Most posts receive around 50 likes, which is not proportional to the station’s number of followers. The station could possibly improve this low engagement by interacting with its followers. For example, its sister station NBC 5 Chicago encourages its followers to tag #nbcchicago for a chance to be featured on the page. In addition, both stations could include visually appealing videos and Instagram stories. Trivia questions and games could also engage followers, along with incentives for free tours of the station or free Telemundo Chicago themed items.	</p>

                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted" id="unipros">Pros</p>
                                		<p>Univision Chicago’s website features local news in the top section of the homepage, making it easy to find. Some sections may especially be appealing to its Hispanic audience, such as the Horoscope section and immigration. </p>
                                		<p>The site also encourages user engagement through social media, with large banners that say “S&iacute;guenos” accompanied by links to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. In addition, the site encourages its users to download the network app. </p>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted" id="unicons">Cons</p>
                                		<p>Although Univision Chicago is a local station, there does not appear to be much content on local news. There seems to be more coverage on entertainment. However, because the site is so disorganized it is relatively hard to tell. There are no clear categories on the site, and the top menu makes it clear that the website is an extension of the network’s website. This is also clear in the URL, http://www.univision.com/chicago/wgbo, which is titled univision.com with chicago as a subdomain. </p>
                                		<p>The site also lacks articles and is purely video and photos. This lack of variety may not appeal to users, who are accustomed to seeing news articles on station websites.</p>
                                	</div>
                                	<div class="tab-pane" id="univisionwebdesign">

                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted" id="unidesktop">Desktop</p>
                                		<p><b>Organization</b>: The site is poorly organized and confusing. There appears to be two menus at the top, one for the network and the other specifically for the local station. However, the menu for the local station is hard to navigate and has left and right arrows to scroll through. Some of the organizational content appears to be unnecessary, such as the hamburger menu to the sites of other stations. The bottom menu is especially confusing and features over 20 options. </p>
                                		<p><b>Photos</b>: The homepage of the website is mostly thumbnails to videos since the site has no articles. However, the photo quality does not appear to be very good. </p>
                                		<p><b>Feature Size</b>: Although the menus are small and hard to navigate, Univision does make good use of its social media icons. They can be easily found in several sections of the site. </p>
                                		<p><b>Ad Size &amp; Placement</b>: There are several ads that may be annoying to the user. Upon opening the homepage, the ads on the sides distract the user from the site’s main content. In addition, the header ad at the very top bumps the rest of the site’s content down, further distracting the user from the posts about local news. </p>
                                		<p><b>White Space</b>: The site has little white space, adding to the disorganized feel of the site. The many thumbnails are crowded on the homepage, leaving a cramped feel. </p>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted" id="unimobile">Mobile</p>
                                		<p><b>Overview</b>: The mobile website looks better than the desktop version does because the thumbnails are split up into different sections in a lightweight design. It is also easier to scroll through the homepage because it is simpler. However, the mobile site has many of problems the desktop version has. </p>
                                		<p><b>Organization</b>: The menu bar for the local station is even easier to overlook on the mobile version since it is even smaller. In addition, the menu items towards the end of the page are simply listed and must be scrolled through, creating an inconvenient experience for the user.</p>
                                		<p><b>Feature Size</b>: The icons on the mobile site are small and easy to overlook on the mobile version of the site. For example, the icons for tiempo (weather) and tr&aacute;fico (traffic) are tiny compared to the large thumbnails. The magnifying glass in the corner could make up for the site’s organizational problems, but because of its small size, the user may not notice it.</p>

                                		<p><b>Overview</b>: Univision Chicago does not have its own app. Rather, it is a section of the network app, which is unorganized and cluttered. Chicago news is simply an option out of over 20 tabs, making it hard to find. Upon opening the app, the option to watch Univision network shows on demand appears. Local news is the last option on the bottom menu.</p>
                                		<p><b>Organization</b>: The app is poorly organized and does not categorize its video content very well. The user simply scrolls through the thumbnails of featured videos, making it hard to find specific content. </p>
                                		<p><b>Push Notifications</b>: Univision’s app sends few notifications about national news, but nothing on local Chicago news.</p>
                                		<p><b>Ad Size &amp; Placement</b>: The app has frequent pop-up ads, along with ads on the top and bottom of the screen that appear at all times. </p>

                                		<p>Univision frequently uses relevant hashtags to increase social media engagement and regularly interacts with followers. Their page also makes use of Facebook Live and event reminders to make sure their viewers tune in. Their response time to direct messages is also very good, and they replied to our private message within five minutes.</p>

                                		<p>Univision Chicago updates its Twitter page consistently updates its Twitter page and often retweets its national page and reporters. These retweets seem to get the most likes on the page, and the station further increases social media engagement by using relevant hashtags and occasionally posting trivia games.</p>
                                		<p class="item-intro text-muted">Social Media: 13 thousand followers</p>
                                		<p>Univision Chicago reposts stories from its talent, attracting some of their followers to its own page. Photos of talent also seem to receive the most likes. The Instagram page does not have a consistent schedule to be updated, and goes through cycles when it posts frequently during one week but nothing the next. </p>
